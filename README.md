# Beat Tracking with Dynamic Programming

Offline beat tracking algorithm for ballroom dance music that combines a LogFiltSpecFlux onset detection function with the global tempo estimation and beat tracking functions presented in the Ellis 2007 paper â€œBeat Tracking by Dynamic Programming. The algorithm takes a dance style label as input, and performance is tuned for the characteristics of each ballroom dance style.

The Ballroom dataset can be downloaded here: http://mtg.upf.edu/ismir2004/contest/tempoContest/node5.html
