# Beat Tracking with Dynamic Programming

Beat tracking algorithm for ballroom dance music that combines the LogFiltSpecFlux onset detection function presented in Krebs 2013 “Rhythmic Pattern Modeling for Beat and Downbeat Tracking in Musical Audio” with the global tempo estimation and beat tracking functions presented in Ellis 2007 “Beat Tracking by Dynamic Programming. The algorithm takes a dance style label as input, and performance is tuned for the characteristics of each ballroom dance style.
